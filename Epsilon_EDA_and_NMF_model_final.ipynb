My initial reaction was to assume that the inferences starting with \"Zip\" or \"Zip2\" were actually breakdowns of the \"Census ZIP\" inferences. However, the \"Census Zip\" inferences cover different types of measurements than those in the \"Zip\" or \"Zip2\" high level categories. Perhaps the \"Census\" inferences actually refer to the source of the underlying daya -- coming from US Census Bureau sources, versus the \"Zip\" and \"Zip2\" inferences that may come from other sources of geography-based data.
